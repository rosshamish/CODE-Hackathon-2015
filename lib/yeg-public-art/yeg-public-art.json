[The work is] a set of six sculptures located in the centre of the grassy space near the Grant MacEwan LRT station. On their own, each is a whimsical, colourful addition to the site. When viewed together from a viewpoint looking through the final sculpture, a picture frame, the sculptures flatten into the classic trope of Western painting: the still life with fruit bowl. The sculptures are spaced with enough distance between them that commuters or students can walk freely between them, entering and exiting the “picture”. In some ways, the sculptures are like a puzzle, one that invites pause in order for curious viewers to solve with their own positioning. However, the piece is designed to also incorporate those who move through it as an equally important part of the experience. The project is titled “Still Life” as a play on the vitality of the site [and is intended] to capitalize on the heavy pedestrian traffic surrounding the rail station by creating a piece that the commuting masses could interact with. The people viewing the piece, or even just passing by, actually activate and animate this Still Life. They turn the installation into a flat image by standing in front of the frame, and change the image by walking amongst the sculptures."

As we now know, there is a periodic table that boasts many elements that make up the complex compounds and substances that exist in the world. Earth, water, fire, and air are not elements but conglomerations of many elements. We have expanded our knowledge but we still fail as stewards of the 4 originals. Elemental highlights how knowledge has expanded. Lessons about new scientific theories, how better to use our resources and guard against pollution, and recycling when possible, are suggested in this installation.” The abstract images refer to the four original elements in a colourful and visually interesting way. The arrangement of the images in grid format references the modern periodic table, and maps the history of human imprint on the original elements.

He writes: “I wanted to reference some of the patterns created by the community members during the seminar, but rather than collaging multiple submissions of pattern design, I decided to simplify and reduce this idea to something I saw recurring in the submissions. The use of ‘Stripes’ or bands represent a commonality amongst one another That together we are all part of a uniform direction, or a common goal. This idea is then contrasted with the use of colour to highlight a sense of individuality. The focal point of the piece is a word piece that reads ‘ARC’ done in a minimal graffiti style. With this aspect of the artwork I wanted to instill the message that graffiti can be more associated with design and craft as opposed to its potential negative associations, ego, violence, etc. I felt as though the community was truly passionate about graffiti as a culture and creative outlet, and through the artwork we can set an example and portray graffiti in its distilled tradition of craft, design and positivity.”"

Artist Marc Fornes describes the sculpture as an “architectural folly,” evoking the decorative, but generally non-practical structures that adorned the great estates of Europe in the 18th & 19th centuries. As a structure, it explores the concept of lightweight, self-supporting elements generated through computations of form and structure as well as descriptive geometry. The use of these processes unifies all elements of the sculpture – its structure, skin and ornamentation – into a single unified system. From a distance, the sculpture’s colours seem to meld seamlessly into one another. Up close, the surface is revealed as an intricate assembly of coloured structural shingles. Although similar, each digitally fabricated strip is unique. The shingles overlap each other creating a strong and thick, but delicate-looking structure. Willow’s colors originated in its immediate natural environment. The artist, realizing the sculpture’s potential as an iconic destination within Borden Park, pushed the hues toward artificiality. The greens and blues blend into a synthetic magenta, imbuing the sculpture with the appearance of motion. Willow’s colour, shape and tracery of light and shadow invite the passerby to stop, explore and play within. BITS AND PARTS: Willow is comprised of 721 aluminum stripes, 14,043 connectors (1/4” aluminum rivets) and 60 epoxy concrete anchors. The aluminum (5052 type) is used in three different thicknesses: 1/8” (3mm) stripes, 1/4” (6mm) at the feet, and 1/2” (10mm) for the 24 base plates that are anchored to a concrete pad of 240 cubic feet.. It took four days, and a crew of 4 to assemble the prefabricated parts."

In resisting gravity the tool may be a humble metaphor for Hope – the sculpture’s title. “In the face of life’s inevitable challenges we are all free to try to look beyond conventions of common thinking, and in that, perhaps we find hope.” Royden Mills"

It was there that i “grew up“ with the glass, practicing skills and learning about hot glass as a material. Having a creative background in photography already, i soon realized that as my attraction to glass grew, it demanded more of my attention and photo ended taking the back seat. It became clear at the time that i had room for only one main creative interest in my life. This transition in creative thoughts although sad was a necessary one and paved the way to a new creative career and a new medium of choice. As a journeyman carpenter with a strong work ethic, I really appreciated how physical the process was in creating glass objects. I draw a lot of parallels between carpentry and glass, one of these parallels is the struggle and challenge it can take me before i can really appreciate the finished result. Nothing worth having or doing seems to come easy for me. During my time with glass i have managed to broaden myself by, helping teach beginner glass classes at Red Deer College and volunteering at Pilchuck glass school as a poleturner. I have had the opportunity to work with other artists and industrial designers in bringing their ideas to life and enjoy the challenge which comes with these new ideas and approaches. I have designed and fabricated custom lighting fixtures for clients, produced recognition and achievement awards for various local organizations, as well as been a successful candidate for a City of Edmonton permanent art installation. I continue to live and work in Edmonton, Alberta with my family and am always in hot pursuit of the next best curry house and the perfect punty."

In very uncertain times, he learned that there was a sense of control to be gained from creating. While all else seemed uncertain, there were certain freedoms in the act of Drawing. Mills became dedicated to a career in Architecture, which took him to a diploma in Architecture and a short freelance career. His studies were funded by working with mentally handicapped people who continually reminded him that the human spirit is such a beautiful thing. At this time he followed his hearts desire and returned to Art School. In school he supplemented his visual studies with reading Buddhism and Taoism and Eastern Philosophy As a Graduate Student, it was an extended assistant-ship with the English Sculptor Sir Anthony Caro that helped to really open his eyes. In the early 90’s his wife, wished to move to Japan for a chance to experience something different. Mills saw this a possibility to learn more about “things” and was able to work in a studio on his own and create sculpture for a solo exhibition there in 1993. When they returned home, Canada and life in the world seemed much different. Mills realized that he could never make sculpture the same way, and could never teach as he had before, either. Royden Mills served as President of The Edmonton Contemporary Artists Society; Board Member at the Art Gallery, Chair of Committees etc., and even a recent role as Curator. All these roles have helped him appreciate the relationships and the work that are involved in bringing art to an audience. Royden Mills – “I feel that we all have very different tastes and life experiences, but we also share many similar values in life. It is these shared feelings that I feel are the most important and defining elements of being human. With my sculpture, my teaching, with my life, I try to explore the limits of our human liberty. Our freedom to explore, to be surprised, and yet to share a familiarity, is the essence of what I am trying to do. I consider all that we do to be a kind of unplanned preparation to further explore freedom.”"

The recipient of numerous provincial, national, and international awards and grants, his work has been exhibited widely, and is held in many private collections. Ken Macklin writes: “To me, making art is a form of narrative that is at once both personal and universal. While I draw much of my inspiration from my own lived experience and the zeitgeist of the modern day, so too do I aim to embody in my work emotions and perspectives that change little across time and space, and are part of shared human experience. What was relevant to the old masters of the past, to Michelangelo, to Goya, and to Rothko, is still relevant, and the essential artistic vocabulary of line, volume, form, and colour is a universal and a constant to me. Nature is another constant and a touch-stone of my work. I am inspired by the dense forests and landscape surrounding my home and studio in northern Alberta near the Alaska highway. Living in a landscape covered by snow for as much as half the year, I look to the tangled clusters of branches, the incredible light that gives such clarity, and to the magnificent colours of the sky and the four seasons. I enjoy mixing materials to make colourful and whimsical pieces that provoke positive emotions in viewers. My work, then, is a study in emotional contrasts, extemporaneous one moment, deliberate the next. It is subtle commentary on personal experience and grounded in the history of art.”"

This lithograph was produced shortly after her death and depicts her comforting spirit, represented by the white form on the right of the image, reminiscient of an accordian-folded map to symbolize their geographical distance. On the left, a mass of tubes are stacked, ready to ship the print to exhibitions around the world, a metaphor for the artist’s professional life in Canada far from her home of Australia. The print is a shadowy picture with subtle touches of colour. The overwhelming darkness communicates the deep-rooted, mournful emotions the artist experienced when her mother passed away. She says of the time, “I was immersed in the creation of a series of prints that were completely derailed as I dealt with the intensity of my feelings.”", "Lyndal Osborne", [ "http://www.lyndalosborne.com/", null ], "Lyndal Osborne was born in Newcastle, Australia. She studied at the National Art School in Sydney and received her MFA from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA . Since 1971, Osborne has been based in Edmonton, and is Professor Emeritus in Department of Art and Design, University of Alberta. Osborne has been exhibiting in Canada and internationally since the early 1970s and has shown in over 360 exhibitions. She is represented in many private and public collections worldwide.

This process took nearly a year to complete with a production style akin to that of the traditional glass artisans in Italy and Poland.

There is an elusive quality to glass that has enchanted people for generations. The materiality of glass is extremely technical, something that Walker feels one never fully masters.

As a journeyman carpenter with a strong work ethic, I really appreciated how physical the process was in creating glass objects.

On the one hand there is an image of trees taken from an angle approximating a bus rider’s view, and on the other hand white and yellow line marker paint has been meticulously added along the lower edge of the image. Despite the representation of trees as nature, the paint lines underscore the fact that we are in an urban environment. In addition, the images are mirrored horizontally and read like a palindrome. This visual cue is echoed in the title of the piece, LEGER/REGEL , and is evocative of the action of commuting in the form of a return trip. The neighborhood of Leger is named after a former Edmonton city alderman, Edmund Hugh Leger, who served in the late ‘50s and early ‘60s. And “regel” happens to be a German word, which roughly translates in English to mean “as a rule, generally or under normal circumstance.” “Regel” would apply to activities like a daily commute, or taking transit on one’s daily errands like shopping or traveling to appointments. It also applies to the ubiquity of the Alberta sky, and the sight of native trees while looking out of the window of a bus, as well as the universally understood meaning of marker paint on a road. Wells’ past work has been on canvas, as performances on site, or as poetic nonfiction that combines theory, history, and personal experience of his work with line markings. LEGER/REGEL is true to Wells’ practice as it is a reworking of the familiar (trees and traffic lines) in an unfamiliar fashion, creating the effect of recognition and re-cognition of the presented image. Like the title, the image is a palindrome— it takes only a moment to register the joke, but given time to understand, the meaning becomes richer.", "C.

Futuristic Map is a relief sculpture made of layered, laser-cut steel with stylized imagery of a map, as the title suggests.

We have architect Peter Hemingway to thank for the original inspiration— in the early ‘70s he designed the now-demolished Central Pentecostal Tabernacle. Part of which was a large pyramid structure- a precursor to the Muttart Conservatory, which he created later in the decade. The Muttart Conservatory is a striking addition to our River Valley, and its four pyramids are mirrored in other elements of civic architecture like Gene Dub’s City Hall design. In 2008, the Muttart Conservatory underwent a renovation, which included interior improvements and the addition of a bold front entryway. To mark the entrance, the City of Edmonton wished to have a black granite pyramid to be engraved with an artist’s design placed at the entry to the new plaza. Vancouver artist Mia Weinberg was commissioned to design the four sides of the pyramid and chose to represent both natural and man-made images, which were sandblasted into the surface of the black granite. Two of the four sides reference the context of the Muttart Conservatory and are engraved with images of plants; one a microscopic view of an aspen leaf and the other a fern frond. The two remaining sides are city maps, the grid-like streets that surround West Edmonton Mall and the more curvy roads of the river valley bisected by the North Saskatchewan River. This juxtaposition points out similarities between the vascular system of plants and the macro-view of our streetscapes— they are both “skeletons” for the organism/city, shuttling nutrients/passengers to where they are needed.

Termerty’s sculpture symbolizes the scar on humanity left by authoritarian political regimes, and more specifically on the Ukrainian people by Josef Stalin. It was commissioned by the Canadian Ukrainian Committee to commemorate the lives lost and acknowledge a little known and poorly understood event in world history. The genocidal famine was enacted to punish farmers for resisting the collectivization of agricultural production. The death of the greatest number of civilians during peacetime occurred when food, livestock and seed grain was removed from the country and the borders were sealed. Following the forced famine of millions of people, the russification of Ukraine saw the extermination of religious, academic, and cultural leaders. Until the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, any record of the genocide was suppressed and those who spoke of it were silenced by the Soviet government. The public unveiling in 1983 by then Mayor Laurence Decore boldly proclaimed the existence of the event and spoke of the connection to the Ukrainian community in Edmonton. Beginning in the 1890s, successive waves of Ukrainian settlers came to the Edmonton area to build homesteads, representing a large portion of the population. The sculpture invites examination of the histories constructed by Soviet Russia and allows members of the larger community to show solidarity against injustices committed against humankind.

It was there that i “grew up“ with the glass, practicing skills and learning about hot glass as a material. Having a creative background in photography already, i soon realized that as my attraction to glass grew, it demanded more of my attention and photo ended taking the back seat. It became clear at the time that i had room for only one main creative interest in my life. This transition in creative thoughts although sad was a necessary one and paved the way to a new creative career and a new medium of choice. As a journeyman carpenter with a strong work ethic, I really appreciated how physical the process was in creating glass objects. I draw a lot of parallels between carpentry and glass, one of these parallels is the struggle and challenge it can take me before i can really appreciate the finished result. Nothing worth having or doing seems to come easy for me. During my time with glass i have managed to broaden myself by, helping teach beginner glass classes at Red Deer College and volunteering at Pilchuck glass school as a poleturner. I have had the opportunity to work with other artists and industrial designers in bringing their ideas to life and enjoy the challenge which comes with these new ideas and approaches. I have designed and fabricated custom lighting fixtures for clients, produced recognition and achievement awards for various local organizations, as well as been a successful candidate for a City of Edmonton permanent art installation.

His works could somehow revive a taste for the paranoid retro-futuristic prophecies pronounced by Charles Fourier two centuries ago.

They create totally new sensory experiences that become vehicles for partially finished products of the imagination to be completed by the viewer.

Boyle Street represents Edmonton’s culturally diverse past and future and aspires to be a destination for people living outside the area.

When they returned home, Canada and life in the world seemed much different. Mills realized that he could never make sculpture the same way, and could never teach as he had before, either. Royden Mills served as President of The Edmonton Contemporary Artists Society; Board Member at the Art Gallery, Chair of Committees etc., and even a recent role as Curator. All these roles have helped him appreciate the relationships and the work that are involved in bringing art to an audience. Royden Mills – “I feel that we all have very different tastes and life experiences, but we also share many similar values in life. It is these shared feelings that I feel are the most important and defining elements of being human. With my sculpture, my teaching, with my life, I try to explore the limits of our human liberty. Our freedom to explore, to be surprised, and yet to share a familiarity, is the essence of what I am trying to do. I consider all that we do to be a kind of unplanned preparation to further explore freedom.”", [ "http://edmontonpublicart.ca/assets/media/art/0d97a786-903b-42fa-bd7b-27a876850079.JPG.1000x667_q85.jpg", null ], [ "http://edmontonpublicart.ca/assets/media/art/e4a157aa-9734-4326-97f4-c8a09e95a8b7.JPG.1000x667_q85.jpg", null ], [ "http://edmontonpublicart.ca/#!/details/117", null ], "53.509732999999997", "-113.5269672", [ null, "53.509733", "-113.5269672", null, false ] ]

The recipient of numerous provincial, national, and international awards and grants, his work has been exhibited widely, and is held in many private collections. Ken Macklin writes: “To me, making art is a form of narrative that is at once both personal and universal. While I draw much of my inspiration from my own lived experience and the zeitgeist of the modern day, so too do I aim to embody in my work emotions and perspectives that change little across time and space, and are part of shared human experience. What was relevant to the old masters of the past, to Michelangelo, to Goya, and to Rothko, is still relevant, and the essential artistic vocabulary of line, volume, form, and colour is a universal and a constant to me. Nature is another constant and a touch-stone of my work. I am inspired by the dense forests and landscape surrounding my home and studio in northern Alberta near the Alaska highway. Living in a landscape covered by snow for as much as half the year, I look to the tangled clusters of branches, the incredible light that gives such clarity, and to the magnificent colours of the sky and the four seasons. I enjoy mixing materials to make colourful and whimsical pieces that provoke positive emotions in viewers.

Graffiti Ideology is often referenced and conveyed through certain stylistic traits and aesthetics. I’m inspired by the abundance and wealth of my visual surroundings – the subtle textures in our natural world and more often, man-made creations in contrast. The work attempts to uncover the link within communication, geometry, landscape, pattern, and colour. Combinations with their respective opposites expose both the contrast, and natural balance of those ideas. My aesthetic is driven with solid colors, bold marks, hard edges, and subtle textures – where their execution can play as both uniform and spontaneous. I work with geometry as a narrative with landscape and perspective in attempt to reveal its role in both nature, and human interaction within it. Referencing my experiences through a small window of representation allows me to feel connected to the viewer in a new way. The moment of inspiration is born again.’", [ "http://edmontonpublicart.ca/assets/media/art/ec20f0d4-cdf0-450d-b873-f8e666f56e59.JPG.1000x667_q85.jpg", null ], [ "http://edmontonpublicart.ca/assets/media/art/f991259c-8647-4425-83b7-97b09a9ed482.jpg.1000x667_q85.jpg", null ], [ "http://edmontonpublicart.ca/#!/details/136", null ], "53.572403999999999", "-113.38977800000001", [ null, "53.572404", "-113.389778", null, false ] ]

As a structure, it explores the concept of lightweight, self-supporting elements generated through computations of form and structure as well as descriptive geometry. The use of these processes unifies all elements of the sculpture – its structure, skin and ornamentation – into a single unified system. From a distance, the sculpture’s colours seem to meld seamlessly into one another. Up close, the surface is revealed as an intricate assembly of coloured structural shingles. Although similar, each digitally fabricated strip is unique. The shingles overlap each other creating a strong and thick, but delicate-looking structure. Willow’s colors originated in its immediate natural environment. The artist, realizing the sculpture’s potential as an iconic destination within Borden Park, pushed the hues toward artificiality. The greens and blues blend into a synthetic magenta, imbuing the sculpture with the appearance of motion. Willow’s colour, shape and tracery of light and shadow invite the passerby to stop, explore and play within. BITS AND PARTS: Willow is comprised of 721 aluminum stripes, 14,043 connectors (1/4” aluminum rivets) and 60 epoxy concrete anchors. The aluminum (5052 type) is used in three different thicknesses: 1/8” (3mm) stripes, 1/4” (6mm) at the feet, and 1/2” (10mm) for the 24 base plates that are anchored to a concrete pad of 240 cubic feet..

The recipient of numerous provincial, national, and international awards and grants, his work has been exhibited widely, and is held in many private collections. Ken Macklin writes: “To me, making art is a form of narrative that is at once both personal and universal. While I draw much of my inspiration from my own lived experience and the zeitgeist of the modern day, so too do I aim to embody in my work emotions and perspectives that change little across time and space, and are part of shared human experience. What was relevant to the old masters of the past, to Michelangelo, to Goya, and to Rothko, is still relevant, and the essential artistic vocabulary of line, volume, form, and colour is a universal and a constant to me. Nature is another constant and a touch-stone of my work. I am inspired by the dense forests and landscape surrounding my home and studio in northern Alberta near the Alaska highway. Living in a landscape covered by snow for as much as half the year, I look to the tangled clusters of branches, the incredible light that gives such clarity, and to the magnificent colours of the sky and the four seasons. I enjoy mixing materials to make colourful and whimsical pieces that provoke positive emotions in viewers.
